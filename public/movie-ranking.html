<h1>The Besst Movies According to Ryan</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Whale</h3>
<p>
    This Whale of a movie, is a masterpiece among the fat people movies.<br /> 
    It shows that fat people are not always happy and want food like Paul blart<br /> 
    but can be sad and want food like in this movie. <br /> 
    I give this a 93/100 because Brandon Fraser could have been in the movie more.<br /> 
</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
    They called me mr.bombastic cause this movie was an explosion.<br />  
    A good explosion. 
    It is like history lesson but loud sounds and it also makes you think you understand bombs.<br /> 
    Cool actors like Iron man and Josh from Drake and Josh made this movie cooler.<br />  
    My favorite was when Rodrick appeared for 10 seconds and said a thing.<br />  
    It made me sleepy but it was still interesting to see if Oppenheimer is a communist or not.<br />  
    Giving it a 97/100 because could have used one more explosion for final Blow!<br />

<h3>Beau Is Afraid</h3>
<p>
    You have to see the movie for yourself
